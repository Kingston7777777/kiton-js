My Framework(module) kiton js. It contains many functions and classes for web development.
Purpose of my Framework:
1. To make it easier for developers who are not use to writing long code. So i wrote functions for javascript developers to make use of.
2. It says time.
3. I developed it not only for developers to make use of it but also for me to have experience developing frameworks.

How to use it:
Step 1:
If you want to import the code first set the type attribute in your script tag to module e.g <script type="module" src="index.js></script>
Step 2:
In your index js file to import it they are 2 ways 
first:you can import part of the code for example
import {changeMe, print} from "./kiton.js"; //add the relative file path
since no alias name look at how you will use the kotin js
let name = "bro"; //you will just use the name and the function since no alias
print(name);
output > bro

second:To import everything
import * as k from "./kiton.js"; //you can give an alias name for it and to use it if you give an alias name look below
e.g
let name = "bro";
k.print(name); // first write the alias name then full stop for you to access the function and classes
output > bro
